# FruitClassificationApp-ios

Created a simple fruit classification ios app that uses vision algorithms to identify 10 different fruits in real-time video. Created the machine learning model (fruitImgClass1.mlmodel) using Core ML, collecting the data using google images and a few pictures taken from my iphone. Used about an 80/20 training/test split for the dataset (140 images - training, 30 images- test). 

The 10 different fruits the model classifies are: 

- apple
- banana
- pear
- orange (classified tangerine as an orange as well)
- strawberry
- blueberry
- kiwi
- lemon
- mango
- tomato (technically a fruit, google it)

- Used Xcode 12, tested on iphone 7
